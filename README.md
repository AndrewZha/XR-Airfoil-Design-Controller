# 🦾 XR Airfoil Design Controller
*Tactile Controller for Hands-on Mixed Reality Airfoil Design*

---

## 🚀 Overview
- This was a controller CAD model for Sandra Bae's XR Airfoil design research at the ACME Lab under the ATLAS Department @ CU Boulder. 
- Premise: this controller acts as an "interactive" airfoil using a projeect VR model. 
- By changing the dials, buttons, and positions of the central axis on the controller, a user can manipulate the features on the VR projected airfoil.
- CAD Model was meant for render-visualization and presentation; however, it CAN be printed and assembled for a physical prototype of the design features and form factor.
- Currently waiting on approval for software development and electrical prototyping

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🔹Controller consists of telescoping arms that allow the disks (evenly spaced points on the middle axis) to move positions and rotate.
- 🔹Each disk has a "controller ring" that can twist. These also have buttons on the sides that allow for changing airfoil properties.
